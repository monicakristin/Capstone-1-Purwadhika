I developed a simple Python application using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage stock, prices, and product information for an iPhone store. This application allows the store owner to efficiently add, delete, and update product stocks, as well as to view the list of available products. By implementing this system, the store owner achieves streamlined inventory management and product information, enhancing operational efficiency and customer service.
